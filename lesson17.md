1. How can the use of tx.origin in a contract be exploited?
require(tx.origin == owner, "Not owner");
The owner can be tricked into calling a Malicious contract ( not owner) which in turns calls function that changes state ( like withdraw money!)
In this case, tx.origin == owner even though the msg.sender != owner

2. What do you understand by event spoofing ?
Event spoofing means deploying contract that can emitting fake logs. Off chain systems like explorer, analytics tool, UI that blindly listesn to event logs without verifying the contract address will be misled into believing untruth like token transfer, etc.

3. What problems can you find in this contract designed to produce a random number.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;


contract Example1{

    uint256 private rand1 =  block.timestamp;

    function random(uint Max) view public returns (uint256 result){

        uint256 rand2 = Max / rand1;
        return rand2 % Max ;
    }
}

### issues:
a. dependency on timestamp of the block which can be out of sync, wrong or manipuliated 
b. time always move forward, hence timestamp always increase hence not random
c. % Max keeps the remainder which is always ranging from 0 to abs(max)-1

4. What problems are there in this contract?

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
contract Course {
    // In this contract the students add themselves via the joinCourse function.
    // At a later time the teacher will via a front end call the welcomeStudents function
    // to send a message to the students and get the number of students starting the course.
    address[] students;
    address teacher = 0x94603d2C456087b6476920Ef45aD1841DF940475;

    event welcome(string,address);
    uint startingNumber = 0;

    function joinCourse()public{
        students.push(msg.sender);
    }

    function welcomeStudents() public{
        require(msg.sender==teacher,"Only the teacher can call this function");
        for(uint x; x < students.length; x++) {
        emit welcome("Welcome to the course",students[x]);
        startingNumber++;
        }
    }
}

###issues:
a. hardcode teacher address==> the contract is not reusuable by other teacher
b. there is no check on whether the msg.sender of joinCourse function has already existed in the students array, so the same students can join twice
